## 👋 About Me

- 📱 **Android Native Developer with 15+ years of experience**
  - Hands-on across the entire evolution: Java → Kotlin → Jetpack Compose
- 🧩 Strong focus on **Clean Architecture / MVVM / MVI**
- 🎨 **Product-minded engineer** who values UI/UX as much as code quality
- ⚙️ Currently expanding into **Embedded systems (STM32)** and **Rust**
  - To better understand how things work beneath the abstraction layers
- ✍️ Enjoys documenting, writing, and sharing practical knowledge

> “Code is a tool.  
> **Building sustainable products is the goal.**”

## 🧭 Fog’s Career Story

From the early days of my career,  
I was never satisfied with simply *shipping features fast*.

Working on long-lived Android products, I repeatedly encountered:
- Growing and tangled codebases  
- UI changes becoming increasingly expensive  
- Maintenance costs quietly dominating development time  

That led to a simple realization:

> **The real problem was rarely the code — it was the structure.**

Since then, my focus has shifted to asking better questions:
- Why does this layer exist?
- Where should this dependency truly belong?
- Will this decision still make sense a year from now?

Recently, I’ve been extending my perspective beyond mobile by studying  
**Embedded systems and Rust**, aiming to become an engineer who understands
not only *how to build on top*, but also *how systems work underneath*.

My personal standard remains unchanged:

> ✨ *Code should be understandable today,  
> resilient tomorrow,  
> and maintainable by the next engineer.*
